# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Red_wine
The project was performed as part of Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree program. 

For this project, I conduct exploratory data analysis on Red Wine dataset using R and explore the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of the data set.

Data source: This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
